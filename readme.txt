== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I refresh meta data on posts? =

In the “Most popular time range settings” section just click save changes.

= Should I use cache for my widget? =

If you are using most popular based on views the widget will pull based on meta data. WordPress does a good job of caching that. You might still want to use it so that you can control the life, duration, of your cache. For other popular types cache will enhance performance.
